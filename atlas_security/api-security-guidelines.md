## Authentication
- Always use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement token-based authentication for API clients
- Rotate API tokens regularly
- Use separate service accounts for different systems integrating with Atlas

## Authorization
- Grant minimal required permissions to each role
- Regularly audit user and role assignments
- Implement resource-based access control for sensitive data

## API Calls
- Validate all inputs before sending to the API
- Implement rate limiting for API requests
- Log all API access for auditing purposes
- Use API versioning to avoid breaking changes

## Secure Integration
- Store credentials securely, never in plain text
- Use environment variables or secure vaults for credentials
- Create dedicated service accounts for ETL processes
- Implement proper error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information

## Network Security
- Use a private network for Atlas communication where possible
- Implement network-level controls (firewalls, security groups)
- Consider using a VPN or private service connect for secure access
